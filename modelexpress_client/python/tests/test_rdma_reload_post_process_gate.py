"""A reload target must not be put through vLLM post-load processing twice.

``prepare()`` exists to bring a freshly dummy-allocated target up to the
processed layout the source published. A reload target is already in that
layout -- it was post-processed before the checkpoint -- and vLLM's post-load
processing is not idempotent, so running it again corrupts the model.

Observed on a CRIU-restored Qwen3-Next-80B replica pulling weights from a peer:

    convert_moe_weights_to_flashinfer_trtllm_block_layout
      w13_rows, w13_cols = w13_weight[0].view(torch.uint8).shape
    ValueError: too many values to unpack (expected 2)

That conversion reshapes MoE experts from ``[E, rows, cols]`` to
``[E, cols/block_k, rows, block_k]``. On the second pass it is handed its own
4-D output, so ``w13_weight[0]`` is 3-D and the two-way unpack fails. The RDMA
attempt dies, the chain falls back to reinit_for_retry, and on a model this size
that rebuild then OOMs -- so a non-idempotent reshape surfaces as an
out-of-memory crash several layers away from its cause.

RdmaStrategy never asks which case it is in: it declares that it does not
deliver through the engine's load_weights(), and the phase runner skips both
phases on a reload for it.
